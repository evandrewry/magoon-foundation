    <h2>Reflection From A Recent Trip To Israel and Palestine Sponsored By The Magoon Foundation</h2>
    <p>"This experience provided professional and personal growth. By visiting various hospitals in the West Bank, I was able to meet other healthcare professionals and form collegial relationships and friendships, some of which I will never forget and already dearly miss.  Many shared their struggles of providing quality healthcare in a limited resource setting. This experience enabled us to personalize their struggles. For me, it renewed my sense of compassion for the sick and suffering.... Once again, I would like to extend my gratitude to the Magoon Foundation for this amazing, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that you have so graciously bestowed upon us."</p>
