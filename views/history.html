<p>The Magoon Foundation honors the life of David Magoon (University of Virginia, 2004) by sponsoring humanitarian projects with specific emphasis on medical education. For the past three years, we have supported small groups of medical students and residents to travel and work in Israel and Palestine. The trip has been led by Dr. David McRay, the fellowship director of the Maternal-Child Health Department at John Peter Smith Hospital in Fort Worth, Texas. Dr. McRay is a renowned leader in global health and family medicine and has been traveling to the region for over 30 years.</p><p>As the Foundation continues to grow, we look for ways to strengthen our relationship with the international medical community, maintaining a keen eye on education. In October of 2013, the Magoon Foundation made it possible for Dr. Samar Musmar, the only US-trained and board-certified family physician in Palestine, to travel to Baltimore to serve as a plenary speaker at an annual global health conference organized by the American Academy of Family Physicians. Dr. Musmar is the Vice-Dean of the An Najah Medical School in Nablus and the director of the first Family Medicine residency program in Palestine, which she founded in 2010.</p><p>In less than three years the Magoon Foundation has touched many lives and continues to build lasting relationships with the goal of promoting medical education and global health initiatives. John Rodney, Luke Smiley and I would like to sincerely thank you for your support as we strive to build upon the early success of the Magoon Foundation and honor our loyal friend from the University of Virginia.</p>
