<p>The Magoon Foundation seeks to sponsor and promote programs devoted to enhancing the quality of healthcare in communities around the world. Most recently, the Foundation has focused on programs centered around the disparate healthcare systems of Israel and Palestine. Over the last three years the Foundation has made it possible for small groups of medical students, residents and doctors to travel to the region on a month-long journey to enhance their learning process, to develop relationships on both sides of the conflict and to bring home the experience to their own communities.</p><p>In addition, the Foundation made it possible for Dr. Samar Musmar, the only US-trained and board-certified family physician in Palestine, to speak at an annual global health conference organized by the American Academy of Family Physicians. The region encompassing Israel and Palestine presents an extraordinary juxtaposition from which to learn. On one side exists one of the most advanced state-run medical systems on earth. On the other side, a developing nation struggles from the scarcity of adequate medical facilities or supplies. The students and doctors on our trips develop meaningful relationships on both sides of the border, using the conflict as a tool that gives them the perspective they need to be leaders in the field of medicine.</p>
